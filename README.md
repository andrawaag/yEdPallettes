# yEd Pallettes
## Description
This repository contains a collection of yEd pallettes that I have created for my own use. The pallettes are in the form of XML files that can be imported into yEd. The pallettes are organized by category and contain a variety of symbols that I find useful for creating diagrams.
yEd is a diagramming tool that I use for creating a variety of diagrams, including flowcharts, network diagrams, and entity-relationship diagrams. It is a powerful tool that is easy to use and has a wide range of features.
yEd comes with a number of built-in pallettes that contain symbols for various types of diagrams. However, I have found that these pallettes are often limited in scope and do not contain all of the symbols that I need. As a result, I have created my own pallettes that contain the symbols that I use most frequently.

The pallettes can be enriched with additional symbols and shapes as needed. I have created a number of pallettes by importing icons from Wikimedia Commons. 

One interesting collection of icons found on [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Life_science_icons_from_DBCLS) originate from the [DataBase Center for Life Science (DBCLS)](https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/index-en.html) in Japan. DBCLS has been so nice to provide a collection of their icons to Wikimedia Commons, which opens them up to the world. 
The nicely integrated in the yED pallettes, which allows them to be used in a variety of diagrams.
